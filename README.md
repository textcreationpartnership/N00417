#A refutation of three opposers of truth, by plain evidence of the Holy Scripture, viz. I. Of Pardon Tillinghast, who pleadeth for water-baptism, its being a Gospel-precept, and opposeth Christ within, as a false Christ. To which is added, something concerning the supper, &c. II. Of B. Keech, in his book called, A tutor for children, where he disputeth against the sufficiency of the light within, in order to salvation; and calleth Christ in the heart, a false Christ in the secret chamber. III. Of Cotton Mather, who in his appendix to his book, called, Memorable providences, relating to witchcraft, &c. doth so weakly defend his father Increase Mather from being justly chargeable with abusing the honest people called Quakers, that he doth the more lay open his father's nakedness; and beside the abuses and injuries that his father had cast upon that people, C. Mather, the son, addeth new abuses of his own. : And a few words of a letter to John Cotton, called a minister, at Plymouth in New England. / By George Keith. ; [Two lines from Zephaniah]#
